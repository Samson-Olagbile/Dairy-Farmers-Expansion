Farmers' Market Expansion\n<p>You have been hired by a farming organisation that helps local farmers sell their products. They want to know whether they should open up a new farmers' market to sell dairy products from nearby farmers. They have supplied you with daily shopping data from a panel of local households from 2019 to 2020. </p>\n<p>The organization will make their decision based on whether dairy products are popular in the area, and whether sales are trending in a positive direction. To answer these questions, they want three pieces of data:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>What was the total number of purchases of dairy products for each month of 2020 (i.e., the <code>total_sales</code>)?</li>\n<li>What was the total share of dairy products (out of all products purchased) for each month of 2020 (i.e., the <code>market_share</code>)?</li>\n<li>For each month of 2020, what was the percentage increase or decrease in total monthly dairy purchases compared to the same month in 2019 (i.e., the <code>year_change</code>)?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The organization handles not only dairy farmers, but also those with chicken farms. As a result, they are only interested in these three categories (which they treat as dairy): ‘whole milk’, 'yogurt' and 'domestic eggs'.</p>\n<p>The data you need is available in the tables shown in the database schema below.</p>\n<h5 id=\"databaseschema\">Database Schema</h5>\n<p><img src=\"https://assets.datacamp.com/production/repositories/5960/datasets/463543c8c38957ca5b95d93b02f2cb1bec53334f/diagram.PNG\" alt=\"Database Schema\" width=\"400px\"></p>"},{"metadata":{"dc":{"key":"3"},"collapsed":true,"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"dc":{"key":"3"},"tags":["sample_code"],"scrolled":false,"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"%%sql\npostgresql:///groceries\n    -- ap represents all products purchased in 2020 --\nWITH ap AS (SELECT CAST(EXTRACT(MONTH FROM (TO_DATE(fulldate, 'YYYY-MM-DD'))) AS INTEGER) AS month, \n             COUNT(p20.purchaseid) AS total_sales_1 \n             FROM purchases_2020 AS p20\n             GROUP BY month),\n\n--dp20 represents dairy products purchased in 2020 --\ndp20 AS (SELECT CAST(EXTRACT(MONTH FROM (TO_DATE(fulldate, 'YYYY-MM-DD'))) AS INTEGER) AS month, \n        COUNT(p20.purchaseid) AS total_sales \n        FROM purchases_2020 AS p20 \n        LEFT JOIN categories AS c ON c.purchase_id = p20.purchaseid \n        WHERE category IN ('whole milk', 'yogurt', 'domestic eggs') \n        GROUP BY month), \n\n-- dp19 represents dairy products purchased in 2019 --\ndp19 AS (SELECT month, COUNT(p19.purchase_id) AS total_sales_2 \n        FROM purchases_2019 AS p19 \n        LEFT JOIN categories AS c ON c.purchase_id = p19.purchase_id \n        WHERE category IN ('whole milk', 'yogurt', 'domestic eggs') \n        GROUP BY month)\n\nSELECT CAST(dp20.month AS INTEGER), CAST(total_sales AS INTEGER),\nROUND(CAST(total_sales::FLOAT * 100/total_sales_1 AS NUMERIC), 2) AS market_share,\nROUND(CAST((total_sales -
